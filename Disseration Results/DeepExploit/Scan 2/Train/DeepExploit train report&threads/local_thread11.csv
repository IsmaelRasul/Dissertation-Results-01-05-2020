This module compiles a Linux shared object file, uploads it to the target host via the UPDATE pg_largeobject method of binary injection, and creates a UDF (user defined function) from that shared object. Because the payload is run as the shared object's constructor, it does not need to conform to specific Postgres API versions.",shell,exploit/linux/postgres/postgres_payload,1,payload/linux/x64/shell_bind_tcp,[URL]@http://www.leidecker.info/pgshell/Having_Fun_With_PostgreSQL.txt@@

The distributed system administration daemon (sadmind) is the daemon used by Solstice AdminSuite applications to perform distributed system administration operations. The sadmind daemon is started automatically by the inetd daemon whenever a request to invoke an operation is received. The sadmind daemon process continues to run for 15 minutes after the last request is completed, unless a different idle-time is specified with the -i command line option. The sadmind daemon may be started independently from the command line, for example, at system boot time. In this case, the -i option has no effect; sadmind continues to run, even if there are no active requests.",shell,exploit/solaris/sunrpc/sadmind_adm_build_path,1,payload/solaris/x86/shell_bind_tcp,[CVE]@2008-4556@@[OSVDB]@49111@@[URL]@http://risesecurity.org/advisories/RISE-2008001.txt@@
