Most commonly this is Perl and Python. When enabled, command execution is possible on the host. To execute system commands, loading the ""untrusted"" version of the language is necessary. This requires a superuser. This is usually postgres. The execution should be platform-agnostic, and has been tested on OS X, Windows, and Linux. This module attempts to load Perl or Python to execute system commands. As this dynamically loads a scripting language to execute commands, it is not necessary to drop a file on the filesystem.

The vulnerability is due to a boundary error within the DCE/RPC preprocessor when reassembling SMB Write AndX requests, which may result a stack-based buffer overflow with a specially crafted packet sent on a network that is monitored by Snort. Vulnerable versions include Snort 2.6.1, 2.7 Beta 1 and SourceFire IDS 4.1, 4.5 and 4.6. Any host on the Snort network may be used as the remote host.
